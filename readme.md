## Requirements

- Go 1.18+


## Usage

1. Get the latest binary from the Releases Tab
2. Open your `<modpack>.mrpack` file using 7Zip, WinRAR or similar and extract it.
3. Run the script:

    ```sh
    ./mrpackdownloader
    ```

4. Enter the path to the `modrinth.index.json` file (from the modpack) OR paste the contents of it into `./modrinth.index.json` (created automatically)

    ```

go build -o mrpackdownloader .
```

## How?

- Modrinth modpacks are just compressed archives, and you can open them using software like 7Zip or WinRAR.
- All this script does is read the `modrinth.index.json` file and save all the mods, resourcepacks etc.
- Files are saved in the `output/` directory, preserving the folder structure.
